# TrainingMongoDB

A simple web application for tracking training events.

**Warning:** This is my first attempt at ASP.NET MVC4 C# with MongoDB, so code is likely to be cruddy.

Used Dr. Dobbs MongoDB with C#: Deep Dive (http://www.drdobbs.com/database/mongodb-with-c-deep-dive/240152181) as starting point.  This article, and the two earlier in the series, Were very useful.

## Features
1. ASP.NET 4 C#
2. [MongoDB](www.mongodb.com)
3. WYSIWYG editing (using [TinyMCE](http://www.tinymce.com))
4. [Twitter Bootstrap 3](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/index.html)
